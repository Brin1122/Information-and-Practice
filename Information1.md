*Formatting text in Markdown

For italics, wrap the item with one star on each side: *one star on each side*.

For bold text, wrap the item with two stars on each side: **two stars on each side**.

For striking through text in GitHub Markdown, wrap the item in two tildes: ~~strikethrough~~.

For links, wrap link text in brackets [ ], and then wrap the URL in parentheses ( ): [This text links to WritetheDocs](https://www.writethedocs.org).

*Headers
If you have longer documents, it is better to give them some structure, which you can actually achieve with headers. Do this with hashes (#):
# This is a first-tier header
## This is a second-tier header
### This is a third-tier header

Horizontal Rule
Create a horizontal rule with three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a line:
---
* * *
